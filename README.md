# TransportationApp

It is a console based application. 

Run TransportationApp/src/org/transport/main/app/TransportationApp.java and please follow the instructions.

There are two types of users:
1.Employees 
2.General Citizens

General Citizens are divided into three categories:
1.Student
2.Senior Citizen 
3.Regular

The price for tickets and discount factor for weekends, senior citizens and students
can be changed easily by changing the values in the Constants file.

The application assumes that the id of the pass will be read by a machine in the real 
world scenario and for this prototype the user will have to input the exact pass id.

The application has stored a list of users that are registered to use the system assuming
that in the real world a database of users will be created.
